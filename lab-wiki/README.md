This repo holds the backend part of the lab wiki website (See **Website** below), as well as some content that is
inappropriate for semi-public access.

## Table of Contents

* Website
* Documentation on maintaining and building the website
* Computation resources
* Private contents
* Ongoing projects
* Feedback
* Links and other goodies
* Legacy

## Where should I contribute

* If your contribution is relevant to a book, a paper, or anything that is closely relevant to some entity that can be appropriately described by a bibliography entry, go to "Documentation on maintaining and building the website". Notice that contents contributed here is visible to everyone in the world. So classified contents should never go here.
* Otherwise, if you consider contribution is classified, OR it satisfies the following criteria
   1. not relevant to a bibliography entry
   2. original
   3. worth long-term storage (this is relatively subjective. Some of my examples: a link to some blog article is not worth long-term storage; a deep analysis of some article can be).
  
  then go to "Private contents"
* Otherwise, go to "Links and other goodies".

### Special cases

* "Computation resources": Computation resource related contributions
* "Ongoing projects": overview of ongoing projects in the lab.

## Website

The website version of the wiki is at <https://leelabcnbc.github.io/lab-wiki/>. Currently, it will give 404 to you, due
to lack of a homepage (which can also be a good thing, which kind of prevents outside people from accessing its content)
To access the content, you must click one of the following links.

* [Reference Library](https://leelabcnbc.github.io/lab-wiki/reference_library/)
* [Miscellaneous Notes](https://leelabcnbc.github.io/lab-wiki/misc_notes/)

## Documentation on maintaining and building the website

One current restriction about website, is that it will only show links for `.ipynb` files with BibTeX entries in it. So if your contribution is not relevant for some book or paper, considering contributing it via "private contents" or "links and other goodies".

* [reference library, etc.](src/README.md)

## Computation resources

Ideally, all documentation related to computation resources should be at <https://github.com/leelabcnbc/computing-resources>. However, it's still empty as there's no contributor. For now, check <https://github.com/leelabcnbc/lab-wiki-before-20170525/wiki/how-to-use-CNBC-cluster> for an outdated version of CNBC cluster and <https://github.com/leelabcnbc/lab-wiki-before-20170525/wiki/perfect-OpenGL-machine> for the `Superman` machine in Lee Lab. In addition, check <https://github.com/leelabcnbc/lab-wiki-before-20170525/wiki#computation> for some other goodies.

## Ongoing projects

Please see and contribute to <https://github.com/leelabcnbc/lab-wiki/wiki/ongoing-projects> for an overview of projects going on in the lab.

## Private contents

Check [here](./private) for member-only contents, such as configuration of experiment equipments, etc. There is not much restriction on formatting. Just remember to update [README.md](./private/README.md) in it appropriately when contributing. Only original contents worth long-term storage should be here. Volatile and not-so-original contributions, such as links to blog articles, etc. should be put in "links and other goodies".

## Links and other goodies

For other useful information, such as sharing some links, please directly update <https://github.com/leelabcnbc/lab-wiki/wiki/links-and-goodies>. Better organization is welcomed.

## Feedback

Please post your comments on the lab wiki, either as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/leelabcnbc/lab-wiki/issues),
or as Slack messages in the `lab-wiki` channel of [Lee Lab Slack](https://leelab.slack.com).


## Legacy

the old wiki is at <https://github.com/leelabcnbc/lab-wiki-before-20170525>. Also, remember to check the [wiki](https://github.com/leelabcnbc/lab-wiki-before-20170525/wiki) part of the old wiki.
