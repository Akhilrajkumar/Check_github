This increased population sparseness of neuronal representation, which led to improved discriminability of movie scenes. However, processing depends on wake/anesthesized state. This study is consistent with previous ones that show neurons in V1 have high lifetime sparseness and reliability. Average activity is close between natural and phase-scrambled movies, but populations sparseness and discriminability are greater for natural movies. So nonlinearities can make higher order correlations explicit. However, this experiment does not provide direct proof for sparse coding, but does provide implications for its usage. "

However, the principles that govern the organization of ensemble activity in the visual cortex during natural visual input are unknown. We recorded populations of up to 500 neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex and characterized the structure of their activity, comparing responses to natural movies with those to control stimuli. We found that higher order correlations in natural scenes induced a sparser code, in which information is encoded by reliable activation of a smaller set of neurons and can be read out more easily. This computationally advantageous encoding for natural scenes was state-dependent and apparent only in anesthetized and active awake animals, but not during quiet wakefulness. Our results argue for a functional benefit of sparsification that could be a general principle governing the structure of the population activity throughout cortical microcircuits.},\n",

They found that visual cortex is simple where lateral V1 connects to a single V2-like area, LM, but it's complex in that there's a string of areas in the lateral extrastriate cortex which receive direct V1 input. This is important because a complex organization suggests that primate extrastriate visual areas are homologues of ancestral areas in rodent visual cortex. \n",

Classical view is that mouse V1 surrounded by 5 distinct areas, more recent view is that V1 is almost completely surrounded by V2L and V2ML. The authors have mapped the projections and visual receptive fields in extrastriate visual cortex of mice; they've shown that V1 is surrounded by at least 9 distinct areas, which have complete maps of the visual field. Authors obtained the maps from 20 dual-tracer and 15 triple-tracer injections. \n",

The mouse extrastriate visual cortex contains at least 9 complete and orderly maps, where each of the maps have a unique topographic organization, size, shape, and location relative to fixed landmarks such as myeloarchitectonic borders and callosal connections. The principle result of triple-anterograde tracing of intracortical connections of V1 is that the retinotopic map of V1 gets remapped into 9 distinct extrastriate cortical fields. In general, the callosal connections do not generally represent the vertical meridian. The authors also found that V1 is connected to 15 visual, somatosensory, motor, and limbic areas. \n",

    "abstract = {It is controversial whether mouse extrastriate cortex has a “simple” organization in which lateral primary visual cortex (V1) is adjoined by a single area V2 or has a “complex” organization, in which lateral V1 is adjoined by multiple distinct areas, all of which share the vertical meridian with V1. Resolving this issue is important for understanding the evolution and development of cortical arealization. We have used triple pathway tracing combined with receptive field recordings to map azimuth and elevation in the same brain and have referenced these maps against callosal landmarks. We found that V1 projects to 15 cortical fields. At least nine of these contain maps with complete and orderly representations of the entire visual hemifield and therefore represent distinct areas. One of these, PM, adjoins V1 at the medial border. Five areas, P, LM, AL, RL, and A, adjoin V1 on the lateral border, but only LM shares the vertical meridian representation with V1. This suggests that LM is homologous to V2 and that the lateral extrastriate areas do not represent modules within a single area V2. Thus, mouse visual cortex is “simple” in the sense that lateral V1 is adjoined by a single V2-like area, LM, and “complex” in having a string of areas in lateral extrastriate cortex, which receive direct V1 input. The results suggest that large numbers of areas with topologically equivalent maps of the visual field emerge early in evolution and that homologous areas are inherited in different mammalian lineages.},\n",

    "  abstract = {The mouse has become an increasingly important animal model for visual system studies, but few studies have investigated local functional circuit organization of mouse visual cortex.  Here we used our newly developed mapping technique combining laser scanning photostimulation (LSPS) with fast voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging to examine the spatial organization and temporal dynamics of laminar circuit responses in living slice preparations of mouse primary visual cortex (V1).  During experiments, LSPS using caged glutamate provided spatially restricted neuronal activation in a specific cortical layer, and evoked responses from the stimulated layer to its functionally connected regions were detected by VSD imaging.  In this study, we first provided a detailed analysis of spatiotemporal activation patterns at specific V1 laminar locations and measured local circuit connectivity.  Then we examined the role of cortical inhibition in the propagation of evoked cortical responses by comparing circuit activity patterns in control and in the presence of GABAa receptor antagonists.  We found that GABAergic inhibition was critical in restricting layer-specific excitatory activity spread and maintaining topographical projections.  In addition, we investigated how AMPA and NMDA receptors influenced cortical responses and found that blocking AMPA receptors abolished interlaminar functional projections, and the NMDA receptor activity was important in controlling visual cortical circuit excitability and modulating activity propagation.  The NMDA receptor antagonist reduced neuronal population activity in time-dependent and laminar-specific manners.  Finally, we used the quantitative information derived from the mapping experiments and presented computational modeling analysis of V1 circuit organization.  Taken together, the present study has provided important new information about mouse V1 circuit organization and response modulation.},\n",

Here, using two-photon calcium fluorescence imaging, we observed the simultaneous dynamics of hundreds of neurons in slices of mouse primary visual cortex (V1). Consistent with a balance of excitation and inhibition, V1 dynamics were characterized by a linear scaling between firing rate and circuit size. Using lagged firing correlations between neurons, we generated functional wiring diagrams to evaluate the topological features of V1 microcircuitry. We found that circuit connectivity exhibited both cyclic graph motifs, indicating recurrent wiring, and acyclic graph motifs, indicating feedforward wiring. After overlaying the functional wiring diagrams onto the imaged field of view, we found properties consistent with Rentian scaling: wiring diagrams were topologically efficient because they minimized wiring with a modular architecture. Within single imaged fields of view, V1 contained multiple discrete circuits that were overlapping and highly interdigitated but were still distinct from one another. The majority of neurons that were shared between circuits displayed peri-event spiking activity whose timing was specific to the active circuit, whereas spike times for a smaller percentage of neurons were invariant to circuit identity. These data provide evidence that V1 microcircuitry exhibits balanced dynamics, is efficiently arranged in anatomical space, and is capable of supporting a diversity of multineuron spike firing patterns from overlapping sets of neurons.},\n",

The principal synaptic targets of FF and FB axons that reciprocally interconnect primary visual cortex (V1) with the higher lateromedial extrastriate area (LM) are pyramidal cells (Pyr) and parvalbumin (PV)-expressing GABAergic interneurons. Recordings in slices of mouse visual cortex have shown that layer 2/3 Pyr cells receive excitatory monosynaptic FF and FB inputs, which are opposed by disynaptic inhibition. Most notably, inhibition is stronger in the FF than FB pathway, suggesting pathway-specific organization of feedforward inhibition (FFI). To explore the hypothesis that this difference is due to diverse pathway-specific strengths of the inputs to PV neurons we have performed subcellular Channelrhodopsin-2-assisted circuit mapping in slices of mouse visual cortex. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained from retrobead-labeled FFV1{\\textrightarrow}LM- and FBLM{\\textrightarrow}V1-projecting Pyr cells, as well as from tdTomato-expressing PV neurons. The results show that the FFV1{\\textrightarrow}LM pathway provides on average 3.7-fold stronger depolarizing input to layer 2/3 inhibitory PV neurons than to neighboring excitatory Pyr cells. In the FBLM{\\textrightarrow}V1 pathway, depolarizing inputs to layer 2/3 PV neurons and Pyr cells were balanced. Balanced inputs were also found in the FFV1{\\textrightarrow}LM pathway to layer 5 PV neurons and Pyr cells, whereas FBLM{\\textrightarrow}V1 inputs to layer 5 were biased toward Pyr cells. The findings indicate that FFI in FFV1{\\textrightarrow}LM and FBLM{\\textrightarrow}V1 circuits are organized in a pathway- and lamina-specific fashion.},\n",

    "Currently, little is known about how internal models influence sensory processing. In this study, the authors show that the activity of neurons in L2/3 of mouse V1 becomes increasingly informative of spatial location. In addition, a subset of V1 neurons exhibited responses that were predictive of upcoming visual stimulus in spatially dependent manner. Visual cortex forms an internal representation of the visual scene based on spatial location and compares this representation with feed-forward visual input.\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been evidence for internal representation of environment in brain from the discovery of spatial maps in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. There is indirect evidence for an influence of internal representation on visual processing. The authors speculate that if a direct influence of spatial maps on visual processing develops with experience, it could manifest as a prediction of visual stimulus based on spatial location. Authors recorded activity of same 1,630 neurons in V1 L2/3 using two-photon imaging of the calcium indicator GCaMP6f. \n",
    "\n",
    "Increase in stimulus selectivity can influence the discriminability of stimuli in the environment. With experience, neurons in V1 that were grating-selective became more selective with time, but that effect cannot be explained by their mean activity. The stability of those selective neurons also increased with experience. V1 neurons developed predictive response to approaching visual stimuli with experience. "

    "Direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs) are specialized for detecting motion along specific axes of the visual field. In mice, several types of DSGCs connect to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, the visual thalamic structure that habours cortical relay neurons. Authors show that there is a di-synaptic circuit linking DSGCs with superficial layers of V1. The circuit pools information from several types of DSGC, converges on a specialized subdivision of dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, and gives direction/orientation-tuned signals to V1. This implies that the mouse has several functionally specialized parllel retino-geniulo-cortical pathways. In addition, direction/orientation-tuned V1 neurons may inherit their characteristic receptive field properties from DSGCs. Author's results suggest that orientation and direction selectivity of neurons in deeper V1 comes from the convergence of retical and thalamic afferents with center-surround receptive fields, and not direction or orientation-tuned receptive fields."

    "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) could possibly regulate activity-dependeent synaptic plasticity in the developing visual cortex. Authors studied the physiological role of BDNF in a transgenic mouse with elevated levels of BDNF in V1. Several in vitro experiments have suggested that BDNFs contribute to neuronal plasticity, the ehancement of synaptic transmission, and the induction and maintenance of LTP. In addition, BDNF has effects on excitatory and inhibitory circuits in cortical neurons. Previous experiments have already establised the roles of neurotrophins in rodent visual cortex plasticity. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the experiment, authors found that as in wild-type rodents, neocortical levesl of BDNF in BDNF-overexpressing transgenic mice increased during postnatal development. However, BDNF mRNA expression in transgenic mice was accelerated and by 5 weeks, BDNF mRNA levels in transgenic mouse neocortex were 3 times normal. The authors also performed monocular deprivation on the mice to measure eye plasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In transgenic and wild-type mouse, neurons responded to orieted bars of moving light in visual field. This is to make sure the neurons in all mice were working properly. Authors then measured ocular dominance plasticity and found that overexpression of BDNF in transgenic mouse V1 did not prevent ocular dominance plasticity. It level was normal, but occured earlier in those mice. Thus, the critical period for transgenic mice ended before P27 (a date), but the ocular dominance distribution of wild-type mice still could change after P27.\n",
