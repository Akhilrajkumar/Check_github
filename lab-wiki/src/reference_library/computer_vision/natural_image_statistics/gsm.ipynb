    "abstract = {Author Summary One of the most important and enduring hypotheses about the way that mammalian brains process sensory information is that they are exquisitely attuned to the statistical structure of the natural world. This allows them to come, over the course of development, to represent inputs in a way that reflects the facets of the environment that were responsible. We focus on the case of information about the local orientation of visual input, a basic level feature for which a wealth of phenomenological observations are available to constrain and validate computational models. We suggest a new account which focuses on the statistics of orientations at nearby locations in visual space, and captures data on how such contextual information modulates both the responses of neurons in the primary visual cortex, and the corresponding psychophysical percepts. Our approach thus helps elucidate the computational and ecological principles underlying contextual processing in early vision; provides a number of predictions that are readily testable with existing experimental approaches; and indicates a possible route for examining whether similar computational principles and operations also support higher-level visual functions.},\n",
